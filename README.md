# We Take Style
We Take Style is an e-commerce website built using React and Firebase. This combination is popular among web developers for its flexibility, ease of use, and scalability. React, a JavaScript library, enables the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Firebase, as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, offers essential services such as authentication, real-time database management, and hosting.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
